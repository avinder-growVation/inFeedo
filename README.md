### Setup & run on local machine

1. Clone the repository: https://github.com/avinder-growVation/inFeedo.git
2. Go to the directory: `cd inFeedo`
3. Install dependencies: `npm install` or `npm i`
4. Run app: `npm run start`

### Brief
This app is created with Node.js and Express. The database used is MySQL. Here's the phpMyAdmin [link](https://admin.dkernels.com/phpmyadmin/tbl_structure.php?db=infeedo&table=tasks&token=8e40753508a596294934f8aa63b35517) to the database & use the following credentials to login:
**Username**: `client`
**Password**: `xB9$AyW9v7PQvu&K.0g`

Here's the Postman workspace invite [link](https://app.getpostman.com/join-team?invite_code=2ef21bf0c149489bf54a2101ce57fbc7) for testing the APIs.

### Notes
1. For the scope of this assignment only, the .env file with database secrets is committed to the version control system.
2. For more complex projects, an ORM tool (like Prisma) could be used for database management.
